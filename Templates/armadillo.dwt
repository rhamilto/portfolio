                  <p>I must admit, it is a rather strange critter to utilize as an 
                    iconic symbol here on my site; however, it is a symbol of 
                    great significance to me because of its role in John Irving's 
                    <em>A Prayer For Owen Meany</em> &mdash; my favorite novel. </p>
                  <p>The following passage from the book will provide some insight 
                    into why I have adopted this unusual symbol as my own.</p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>But my greatest indignation was to follow: missing from 
                      the <b>armadillo</b> were the little animals front claws &mdash; the 
                      most useful and impressive parts of its curious body. Owen 
                      had returned the <b>armadillo</b>, but he'd kept the claws!</p>
                    <p>Well &mdash; friendship being one thing, and the <b>armadillo</b> 
                      quite another &mdash; I was so outraged by the discovery that 
                      I needed to talk to Dan Needham. As always, Dan made himself 
                      available. He sat on the edge of my bed while I sniveled; 
                      without its claws, the beast could no longer stand upright 
                      &mdash; not without pitching forward and resting on its snout. 
                      There was virtually no position I could find for the <b>armadillo</b> 
                      that did not make the creature resemble a supplicant &mdash; 
                      not to mention, a wretched amputee. I was quite upset at 
                      how my best friend could have done this to me, until Dan 
                      Needham informed me that this was precisely what Owen <em>felt</em> 
                      he had done to me, and to himself: that we were both maimed 
                      and mutilated by what had happened to us.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your friend is most original,&quot; Dan Needham said, 
                      with the greatest respect. &quot;Don't you see, Johnny? 
                      If he could, he would cut off his <em>hands</em> for you &mdash; 
                      that's how it makes him feel, to have <em>touched</em> that 
                      baseball bat, to have swung that bat with those results. 
                      It's how we <em>all</em> feel &mdash; you and me <em>and</em> Owen. 
                      We've lost a part of ourselves.&quot; And Dan picked up 
                      the wrecked <b>armadillo</b> and began to experiment with 
                      it on my night table, trying &mdash; as I had tried &mdash; to find 
                      a position that allowed the beast to stand, or even to lie 
                      down, with any semblance of comfort or dignity; it was quite 
                      impossible. The thing had been crippled; it was rendered 
                      an invalid. And how had Owen arranged the claws? I wondered. 
                      What sort of terrible altarpiece had he constructed? Were 
                      the claws gripping the murderous baseball?</p>
                    <p>And so Dan and I became quite emotional, while we struggled 
                      to find a way to make the <b>armadillo</b>'s appearance 
                      acceptible &mdash; but that was the point, Dan concluded: there 
                      was no way that any or all of this <em>was</em> acceptible. 
                      What had happened was unacceptible! yet we still had to 
                      live with it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It's brilliant, really &mdash; it's absolutely original,&quot; 
                      Dan kept muttering, until he fell asleep on the other twin 
                      bed in my room, where Owen had spent so many nights, and 
                      I covered him up and let him sleep. When my grandmother 
                      came to kiss me good night, she kissed Dan good night, too. 
                      Then, in the weak glow from the night-light, I discovered 
                      that by opening the shallow drawer under the top of the 
                      night table, I could position the <b>armadillo</b> in such 
                      a way that it was possible for me to imagine it was something 
                      else. Half in and half out of the drawer, the <b>armadillo</b> 
                      resembled a kind of aquatic creature &mdash; it was all head 
                      and torso; I could imagine that those were some sort of 
                      stunted flippers protruding where its claws had been.</p>
                    <p>Just before I fell asleep, I realized that everything Dan 
                      had said about Owen's intentions was correct. How much it 
                      has meant to my life that Dan Needham was almost never wrong&hellip;</p>
