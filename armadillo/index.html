				  <h1>An Armadillo?</h1>
				  <img src="/assets/images/apfom.jpg" class="alignRight cover" alt="A Prayer for Owen Meany cover" />
				  <p>I must admit, it <em>is</em> a rather strange critter to utilize as an
					icon on my site; however, it is a symbol of
					great significance to me because of its role in John Irving's
					<em>A Prayer For Owen Meany</em>&mdash;my favorite novel. </p>
				  <p>I hope the following passage from the book provides some insight
					into why I adopted this unusual symbol as my own&mdash;the armadillo is ultimately a
					symbol of forgiveness, friendship, and hope.</p>
				  <blockquote>
					<p>But my greatest indignation was to follow: missing from
					  the <strong>armadillo</strong> were the little animals front claws&mdash;the
					  most useful and impressive parts of its curious body. Owen
					  had returned the <strong>armadillo</strong>, but he'd kept the claws!</p>
					<p>Well&mdash;friendship being one thing, and the <strong>armadillo</strong>
					  quite another&mdash;I was so outraged by the discovery that
					  I needed to talk to Dan Needham. As always, Dan made himself
					  available. He sat on the edge of my bed while I sniveled;
					  without its claws, the beast could no longer stand upright
					&mdash;not without pitching forward and resting on its snout.
					  There was virtually no position I could find for the <strong>armadillo</strong>
					  that did not make the creature resemble a supplicant&mdash;					  not to mention, a wretched amputee. I was quite upset at
					  how my best friend could have done this to me, until Dan
					  Needham informed me that this was precisely what Owen <em>felt</em>
					  he had done to me, and to himself: that we were both maimed
					  and mutilated by what had happened to us.</p>
					<p>&quot;Your friend is most original,&quot; Dan Needham said,
					  with the greatest respect. &quot;Don't you see, Johnny?
					  If he could, he would cut off his <em>hands</em> for you&mdash;					  that's how it makes him feel, to have <em>touched</em> that
					  baseball bat, to have swung that bat with those results.
					  It's how we <em>all</em> feel&mdash;you and me <em>and</em> Owen.
					  We've lost a part of ourselves.&quot; And Dan picked up
					  the wrecked <strong>armadillo</strong> and began to experiment with
					  it on my night table, trying&mdash;as I had tried&mdash;to find
					  a position that allowed the beast to stand, or even to lie
					  down, with any semblance of comfort or dignity; it was quite
					  impossible. The thing had been crippled; it was rendered
					  an invalid. And how had Owen arranged the claws? I wondered.
					  What sort of terrible altarpiece had he constructed? Were
					  the claws gripping the murderous baseball?</p>
					<p>And so Dan and I became quite emotional, while we struggled
					  to find a way to make the <strong>armadillo</strong>'s appearance
					  acceptible&mdash;but that was the point, Dan concluded: there
					  was no way that any or all of this <em>was</em> acceptible.
					  What had happened was unacceptible! yet we still had to
					  live with it.</p>
					<p>&quot;It's brilliant, really&mdash;it's absolutely original,&quot;
					  Dan kept muttering, until he fell asleep on the other twin
					  bed in my room, where Owen had spent so many nights, and
					  I covered him up and let him sleep. When my grandmother
					  came to kiss me good night, she kissed Dan good night, too.
					  Then, in the weak glow from the night-light, I discovered
					  that by opening the shallow drawer under the top of the
					  night table, I could position the <strong>armadillo</strong> in such
					  a way that it was possible for me to imagine it was something
					  else. Half in and half out of the drawer, the <strong>armadillo</strong>
					  resembled a kind of aquatic creature&mdash;it was all head
					  and torso; I could imagine that those were some sort of
					  stunted flippers protruding where its claws had been.</p>
					<p>Just before I fell asleep, I realized that everything Dan
					  had said about Owen's intentions was correct. How much it
					  has meant to my life that Dan Needham was almost never wrong&hellip;</p>
